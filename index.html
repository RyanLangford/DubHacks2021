                <h1>Project Summary</h1>
                <p>During the pandemic, we have found it very challenging to maintain our connections with our friends, families, and coworkers. One can only imagine how much harder this would be if you were limited in the online resources you had assess to. Our goal for this project is to improve the video conferencing application ZOOM to make it more assessibly to less represnted groups of people such as people who are
                <ul>
                    <li>Hard of hearing or sight</li>
                    <li>Not tech savvay</li>
                    <li>Not speaking the same language</li>
                </ul>
                We thought ZOOM was a good application to focus on because it has exploded in poopularity during the pandemic and is widley used for collaberation, communication, and human connection in an online environment. Therefore, we thought that ZOOM could use an accessibility overhaul to increase the population that can effectivly use it. In order to do this, we aim to make the UI, logic, and functionality of ZOOM much simpler. We do this by
                <ul>
                    <li>item 1</li>
                    <li>item 2</li>
                    <li>item 3</li>
                    <li>item 4</li>
                </ul>
                With these changes, we believe that ZOOM is much more accessible to a wider range of people. This is important because ZOOM has become one of the most popular forms of connection between people during the pandemic. Human connection remains an important aspect of human life, even during a global pandemic. We hope our project gives insight on some of the ways we can make human connection more assessible to people all over the globe.
